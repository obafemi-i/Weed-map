### Weed-Maps Scraper

Install dependencies before running the script, to install dependecies run the command below in the terminal `pip install -r requirements.txt`

A sample output of the scraper is in the sample.csv file.

The scraped results are saved in a "output.csv" file. If you wish to change the name of the file, go to line number 6, the output variable in the main.py file and change the value. Like this; output = 'output.csv' , change to, output = 'anything-you-want.csv'
